  an /exact/ flow theory of peripheral jets issuing symmetrically
from a hovering aerial-ground vehicle is presented .  the
theory is exact insofar as no simplifying assumptions have been
made in obtaining a solution of the governing inviscid, twodimensional
hydrodynamical flow equations .  the results are
valid for all jet thickness vehicle height ratios .  the limit of
applicability of existing theories (very low thickness height
ratios) are defined .  jet reaction, lift, and power coefficients for
static conditions are introduced and computed .  lift augmentation
and lift power ratios are also calculated .
  applications to three-dimensional vehicles with rotational
symmetry are indicated .
