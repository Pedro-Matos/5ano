kuchemann, d.
the methods of the classical aerofoil theory are used to derive a
general theory for wings of any given planform . the load over the
whole surface of a given wing can be calculated at a given subcritical
mach number, and the procedure is as simple and rapid as that of the
classical aerofoil theory . the calculated results are confirmed by
experiments .
