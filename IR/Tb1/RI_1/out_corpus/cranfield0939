in order to simplify the process of estimating the aerodynamic
loading on the after portions of slender vehicles, it is frequently
assumed that there is no nose-tail interaction .  it is
the purpose of this note to show that, aside from boundary-layer
effects, this assumption is not warranted when the nose hypersonic-similarity
parameter, tan, is of the order of unity, or
greater .  physically speaking, the entropy change associated
with a strong bow wave reduces the stagnation pressure downstream
of the shock, and hence, lowers the dynamic pressure in
the vicinity of the tail .
