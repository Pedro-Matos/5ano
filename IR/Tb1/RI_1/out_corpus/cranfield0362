in ref. 1, an alternative semi-empirical formulation for flutter in a
real fluid is given .  for more accurate determination of the empirical
coefficients, the three-dimensional effect of finite span should be
taken into account . following reissner's approximation for largeaspect-ratio
rectangular wings, the boundary-value problem governing the
downwash w and the vorticity distribution .
