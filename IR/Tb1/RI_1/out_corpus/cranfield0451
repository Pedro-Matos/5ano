the work of a. m. liapunov and his theory of stability is discussed .
the second method of liapunov is shown to have applications for linear
equations with real constant coefficients, for a proof of the routhhurwitz
criterion, and linear equations with periodic coefficients .
practical examples include non-linear stability problems of control, and
 the functions have uses in other areas of control systems .
