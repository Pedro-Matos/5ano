current interest in the problem of inviscid-viscous interaction
has led to the realization of the significant effect of
the leading-edge thickness in hypersonic flow .  the purpose
of this note is to give an account of the downstream influence
of the blunt leading edge on the basis of the hypersonic small
perturbation theory .
