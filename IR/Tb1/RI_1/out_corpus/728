the determination of the natural frequencies and normal modes of vibration
for continuous panels, representing more or less typical fuselage
skin-panel construction for modern airplanes, is discussed in this paper
are considered . a numerical example is presented, and analytical
results for a particular structural configuration agree favorably with
available experimental measurements .
