  simplified theoretical approaches
are shown, based on hypersonic
similarity boundary-layer theory,
which allow reasonably accurate estimates
to be made of the surface
pressures on plates on which viscous
effects are important .  the consideration
of viscous effects includes
the cases where curved surfaces,
stream pressure gradients, and leadingedge
bluntness are important factors .
