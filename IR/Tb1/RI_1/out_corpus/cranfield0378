eckert, e.
in calculations of thermodynamic heating for high speed missiles parameters
have been used based on relationships which hold for constantproperty
fluids . the validity of this procedure has been verified
recently in a survey of heat transfer in which a relationship for the
reference temperature was developed . a calculation procedure for
laminar and turbulent boundary layers, based on this relationship, is
given .
