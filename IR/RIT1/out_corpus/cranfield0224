jones,j.g.
  a formula for the velocity field in terms of a given surface distribution
of vorticity is applied to points
lying on the surface .  an equation
giving the shape of a quasi circularcylindrical
surface in terms of a prescribed
loading is derived .  as an
example a half ring wing with prescribed
loading is discussed .
